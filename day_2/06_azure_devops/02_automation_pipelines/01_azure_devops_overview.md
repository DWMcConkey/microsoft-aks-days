# Azure DevOps Overview

Azure DevOps is an end to end solution designed to help team implement DevOps practices in each of an applications lifecycle phases.

## Plan
Empower teams to manage their work with agility and full visibility across products and projects. Define, track, and lay out work with Kanban boards, backlogs custom dashboards and reporting capabilities using Azure Boards. Keep development efforts transparent and on schedule with GitHub. Explore analytics with visuals and turn data into insights with Power BI.

## Develop
Code faster and smarter with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Share code and collaborate with like-minded developers with GitHub. Automate testing and practice continuous integration in the cloud with Azure Pipelines, create automatic workflows from idea to production with GitHub Actions, and even bring your Jenkins workloads to the Azure. Provision environments for developers in minutes with Azure DevTest Labs.

## Deliver
Deploy your application to any Azure service automatically and with full control to continuously deliver value to customers. Define and spin up multiple cloud environments with Azure Resource Manager or HashiCorp Terraform, then create continuous delivery pipelines into these environments using Azure Pipelines or tools such as Jenkins and Spinnaker.

## Operate
Implement full stack monitoring, get actionable alerts, and gain insights from logs and telemetry with Azure Monitor. Manage your cloud environment with Azure Automation and tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.

Keep provisioned infrastructure and applications in compliance with Azure Blueprints or Chef Automate. Used with Azure Security Center, youâ€™ll limit threat exposure as well as find and remediate vulnerabilities quickly.
