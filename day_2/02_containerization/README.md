# Docker Overview

This is the documentation for an **Introduction to Docker** for Redapt's "Microsoft DevOps Workshop".

by Jerry Meisner and Christoph Champ for Redapt, Inc. (August 2018)

**Docker** is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.
> Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in. [Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

*NOTE: This document assumes you already have Docker installed. If you do not already have Docker installed, please use the directions found [linux](02_install_docker.md) and for [windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
