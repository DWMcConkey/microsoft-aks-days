# AKS

Azure Provides a managed Kubernetes cluster service, that you can utilize to deploy your workloads.

In this section, we will walk through setting up an AKS cluster, which you can use to experiment in the coming sections and demonstrations.

15. In your command line, type `az login` and follow the instructions.
16. Run `az aks install-cli` to install `kubectl` into your local environment. **Note: If you are using Azure Cloud Shell, you can skip this step.**
17. Run `az aks get-credentials -n jm-cluster -g jm-rgp` with your flags to set the kubectl context.


**Running into issues kicking off the process due to unique restrictions?**

The az cli tool, allows for additional options to be configured.

If the issues are network related, this information is helpful for troubleshooting/identifying network setup issues.

## Validate

After performing the steps above, you should be able to run the following command, and see some Pods running.

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`


## Creating/Scaling Node Pools 

The Azure Portal UI has some limitations, in terms of managing the node pools, as much of the functionality is in preview. Its recomended to get familiar with the az cli approach.

## Enabling SSH

We will follow the azure docs for getting ssh access.

## Continuing

The next sections wll explain kubectl, and give you a chance to flex some of these actions against your AKS cluster.
